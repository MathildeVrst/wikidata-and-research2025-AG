  abstract = {Abstract             We discuss Shape Expressions (ShEx), a concise, formal, modeling and validation language for RDF structures. For instance, a Shape Expression could prescribe that subjects in a given RDF graph that fall into the shape ``Paper'' are expected to have a section called ``Abstract'', and any ShEx implementation can confirm whether that is indeed the case for all such subjects within a given graph or subgraph.             There are currently five actively maintained ShEx implementations. We discuss how we use the JavaScript, Scala and Python implementations in RDF data validation workflows in distinct, applied contexts. We present examples of how ShEx can be used to model and validate data from two different sources, the domain-specific Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and the domain-generic Wikidata knowledge base, which is the linked database built and maintained by the Wikimedia Foundation as a sister project to Wikipedia. Example projects that are using Wikidata as a data curation platform are presented as well, along with ways in which they are using ShEx for modeling and validation.             When reusing RDF graphs created by others, it is important to know how the data is represented. Current practices of using human-readable descriptions or ontologies to communicate data structures often lack sufficient precision for data consumers to quickly and easily understand data representation details. We provide concrete examples of how we use ShEx as a constraint and validation language that allows humans and machines to communicate unambiguously about data assets. We use ShEx to exchange and understand data models of different origins, and to express a shared model of a resource's footprint in a Linked Data source. We also use ShEx to agilely develop data models, test them against sample data, and revise or refine them. The expressivity of ShEx allows us to catch disagreement, inconsistencies, or errors efficiently, both at the time of input, and through batch inspections.             ShEx addresses the need of the Semantic Web community to ensure data quality for RDF graphs. It is currently being used in the development of FHIR/RDF. The language is sufficiently expressive to capture constraints in FHIR, and the intuitive syntax helps people to quickly grasp the range of conformant documents. The publication workflow for FHIR tests all of these examples against the ShEx schemas, catching non-conformant data before they reach the public. ShEx is also currently used in Wikidata projects such as Gene Wiki and WikiCite to develop quality-control pipelines to maintain data integrity and incorporate or harmonize differences in data across different parts of the pipelines.},

However, a focused discussion regarding the current status, potential, and challenges of its application in the field is still lacking. A systematic review was conducted to identify and evaluate how DH projects perceive and utilize Wikidata, as well as its potential and challenges as demonstrated through use. This research concludes that: (1) Wikidata is understood in the DH projects as a content provider, a platform, and a technology stack; (2) it is commonly implemented for annotation and enrichment, metadata curation, knowledge modelling, and Named Entity Recognition (NER); (3) Most projects tend to consume data from Wikidata, whereas there is more potential to utilize it as a platform and a technology stack to publish data on Wikidata or to create an ecosystem of data exchange; and (4) Projects face two types of challenges: technical issues in the implementations and concerns with Wikidata's data quality. In the discussion, this article contributes to addressing three issues related to coping with the challenges in the specific context of the DH field based on the research findings: the relevance and authority of other available domain sources; domain communities and their practices; and workflow design that coordinates technical and labour resources from projects and Wikidata.},

This paper introduces the project Usable Authorities for Data-driven Cultural Heritage Research, in which the Nationalmuseum and the National Historical Museums, in partnership with Wikimedia Sverige, explore this new area.  The aim of our project is to develop and evaluate methods of linking museum authority data to Wikidata, with the ultimate goal of making it easier for researchers and other users to find, understand and analyze relevant information distributed across different museum collections. The project includes visualizations of relations between historical persons and places to show the potential of otherwise abstract large amounts of data. Another aim is to increase the knowledge about Wikidata and its possibilities among cultural heritage institutions in Sweden, encouraging them to use the data and resources accumulated on the Wikimedia platforms, as well as to actively contribute to them themselves.  The project has proven to be an innovative case study on what is required from a cultural heritage institution to make their data more open and shareable. The focus is on cleaning up the authority data in the museums' databases, including correcting errors and deleting duplicates. The data is there aligned with Wikidata using OpenRefine, so that relevant Wikidata items can be updated with the museums' identifiers. Later on, by developing attractive visualizations, the data is brought to life, highlighting how much information Wikidata volunteers have contributed with and how it complements the museums' own knowledge bases. The visualizations showcase how Wikidata, by being heavily structured and machine-readable, enables the development of new applications that bring the data closer to the users.},

For name authority thesauri in particular I would like to suggest a fundamental break with the current distributed linked data paradigm: to make a transition from a multitude of different identifiers to using a single, universal identifier for all relevant named entities, in the form of the Wikidata identifier. Wikidata (https://wikidata.org) seems to be evolving into a major authority hub that is lowering barriers to access the web of data for everyone. Using the Wikidata identifier of notable entities as a common identifier for connecting resources has significant benefits compared to traversing the ever-growing linked data cloud. When the use of Wikidata reaches a critical mass, for some institutions, Wikidata could even serve as an authority control mechanism.},

Quantitative data and qualitative comparison show that VIAF and Wikidata are quite different in their purpose, scope, organizational and theoretical approach, data harvesting, and management. The study highlights the reciprocal role of VIAF and Wikidata and its helpfulness in the worldwide bibliographical context and in the semantic web environment and outlines new perspectives for research and cooperation.},

Il émerge un nouveau milieu de communication, de pensée et de travail pour les sociétés humaines: le cyberespace. Comment notre culture en sera-t-elle affectée ? N'aboutirons-nous qu'à une super-télévision où renouvellerons-nous le lien social dans le sens d'une plus grande fraternité ? Pierre Lévy nous invite dans ce livre à ne plus penser en termes d'impact des techniques sur la société, mais de projet. Les nouveaux moyens de communication permettent aux groupes humains de mettre en commun leurs imaginations et leurs savoirs. Forme sociale inédite, le collectif intelligent peut inventer une "démocratie en temps réel". L'auteur situe le projet de l'inintelligence collective dans une perspective anthropologique de longue durée. Après avoir été fondés sur le rapport au cosmos, puis sur l'appartenance aux territoires, et finalement sur l'insertion dans le processus économique, l'identité des personnes et le lien social pourraient bientôt s'épanouir dans l'échange des connaissances.},

The (par)etymology of names – be they real or fictitious – is exploited for a variety of purposes and in a variety of ways. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the discussion on the broad topic of proper names in Greek epigrams by offering some reflections on a thorny problem: textual variants involving proper names as evidence of the (authorial?) revision and reuse of texts. A new survey and critical discussion of the (scanty) existing evidence will be provided. Particular attention will be paid to the etymology of proper names, which, in some cases, might suggest a substitution for the purpose of increasing the efficacy of the poetic message.},
