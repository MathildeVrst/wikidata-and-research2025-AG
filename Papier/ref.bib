  abstract = {Abstract             Wikidata has been widely used in Digital Humanities (DH) projects. However, a focused discussion regarding the current status, potential, and challenges of its application in the field is still lacking. A systematic review was conducted to identify and evaluate how DH projects perceive and utilize Wikidata, as well as its potential and challenges as demonstrated through use. This research concludes that: (1) Wikidata is understood in the DH projects as a content provider, a platform, and a technology stack; (2) it is commonly implemented for annotation and enrichment, metadata curation, knowledge modelling, and Named Entity Recognition (NER); (3) Most projects tend to consume data from Wikidata, whereas there is more potential to utilize it as a platform and a technology stack to publish data on Wikidata or to create an ecosystem of data exchange; and (4) Projects face two types of challenges: technical issues in the implementations and concerns with Wikidata's data quality. In the discussion, this article contributes to addressing three issues related to coping with the challenges in the specific context of the DH field based on the research findings: the relevance and authority of other available domain sources; domain communities and their practices; and workflow design that coordinates technical and labour resources from projects and Wikidata.},

  abstract = {The development of Wikidata as the web's central authority hub has created new opportunities for cultural heritage institutions wishing to make their data more visible, accessible and relevant. This paper introduces the project Usable Authorities for Data-driven Cultural Heritage Research, in which the Nationalmuseum and the National Historical Museums, in partnership with Wikimedia Sverige, explore this new area.  The aim of our project is to develop and evaluate methods of linking museum authority data to Wikidata, with the ultimate goal of making it easier for researchers and other users to find, understand and analyze relevant information distributed across different museum collections. The project includes visualizations of relations between historical persons and places to show the potential of otherwise abstract large amounts of data. Another aim is to increase the knowledge about Wikidata and its possibilities among cultural heritage institutions in Sweden, encouraging them to use the data and resources accumulated on the Wikimedia platforms, as well as to actively contribute to them themselves.  The project has proven to be an innovative case study on what is required from a cultural heritage institution to make their data more open and shareable. The focus is on cleaning up the authority data in the museums' databases, including correcting errors and deleting duplicates. The data is there aligned with Wikidata using OpenRefine, so that relevant Wikidata items can be updated with the museums' identifiers. Later on, by developing attractive visualizations, the data is brought to life, highlighting how much information Wikidata volunteers have contributed with and how it complements the museums' own knowledge bases. The visualizations showcase how Wikidata, by being heavily structured and machine-readable, enables the development of new applications that bring the data closer to the users.},

  abstract = {GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) organisations host extensive digital collections that have been made available to the public for over three decades. Advances in technology have facilitated the reuse of digital collections as rich data sources. In this context, Wikidata has emerged as a leading, innovative, and collaborative platform that enriches the digital collections provided by GLAM institutions. However, a comprehensive analysis of the current status, potential and challenges of its use in the GLAM sector is still lacking. This paper presents a systematic review of Wikidata use in GLAM institutions within the context of the work of the International GLAM Labs Community (glamlabs.io). The results summarise academic literature on Wikidata projects. The paper argues that Wikidata's potential in the domain of reuse, an important component of the FAIR principles, can be better integrated into the practices of GLAM institutions.},
